# Welcome to My Project Files

Robotics is my passion. I started building my own contraptions at the age of 14, using mostly with plastic construction pieces. One of my earliest robots was a massive [K'nex Robotic Arm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M24NSTdlk6I) that sported basic ultrasonic sensors and hobby motors. Since then, the robotics field has grown in applications and my intrigue has expanded with it. 

## I.A.R.M. 3.0 (Interactive Autonomous Robotic Manipulator)

Generation 3 of my Interactive Autonomous Robotic Manipulators (I.A.R.M.), this initiative is my first design fabricated entirely from 3D-printed parts. The end state is equally as ambitious; employ machine learning techniques to play chess against a human opponent in real-time...and win! To accomplish this, the IARM 3.0 chassis contrains 5 degrees of freedom (DOF) powered by stepper motors. All computer vision and artificial intelligence capabilities will be handled by an NVIDIA Jetson Nano and OAK-D stereoscopic camera.
